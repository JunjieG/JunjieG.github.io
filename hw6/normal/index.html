            <p>Pikachu (Japanese: ピカチュウ Pikachu) is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
                It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a
                Thunder Stone. However, the starter Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless
                it is traded and evolved on another save file.
                In Alola, Pikachu will evolve into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.
                Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and a major representative of
                Nintendo's collective mascots.
                It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon of Pokémon Yellow and Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!. It has
                made numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.
                Pikachu is also the starter Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World.</p>
